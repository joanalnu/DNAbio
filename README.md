# DNAbio
This is a project that I conducted in 10th grade, after being teached genetics at school.

Please, read the [Protein Biosynthesis and DNA mutations.pdf](https://github.com/joanalnu/DNAbio/blob/main/Protein%20Biosynthesis%20and%20DNA%20mutations.pdf) file.

If you're are looking for the Genetics 10 project (Jupyter Notebook interactives) go to the Genetics10 [folder]([https://github.com/joanalnu/](https://github.com/joanalnu/DNAbio/Genetics10/)

Thank you for your interest!
